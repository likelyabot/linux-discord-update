# Discord Update or Install
Simple python script to install and/or update Discord for Linux.
This should be distrobution agnostic.

This will install and update Discord to /opt/Discord/ and create a launcher file for you.

Every time Discord releases an update, this script can be ran in place of manually downloading, extracting, and copying files from their .tar.
